This library provides fast, lightweight and low-level memory allocators for .NET.

> **Note**: This library is still in early development and is not yet ready for production use.

## âœ¨ Features

- Implementation of a [TLSF (Two-Level Segregated Fit) allocator](http://www.gii.upv.es/tlsf/) with the following features
  - Implementation of the paper [TLSF: a NewDynamic Memory Allocator for Real-Time Systems](http://www.gii.upv.es/tlsf/files/papers/ecrts04_tlsf.pdf)
  - Provides an agnostic backend chunk allocator architecture (native memory, managed memory, custom e.g GPU memory...)
  - 4GB of addressable maximum allocation size.
  - Minimum allocation size/alignment of 64 bytes (32 bytes overhead per allocation)
  - Configurable power-of-two alignment per allocator instance.
- NativeAOT compatible.
- Support for `net8.0`+
